# Extraction Gamemode

Hectic PvE game mode where players have to complete a series of objectives before getting extracted with a dropship.

Base gameplay rules:
- Pilots starts with only P2016, other weapons needs to be found in weapon crates, break those by shooting or meleeing.
- Pilots starts with Jumpkit and Tactical disabled, scout for the robot banks (hardpoints) to find them.
- Pilots are incapacitated before dying.
- Upon death, the alive team mates needs to respawn the dead by hacking the Respawn Terminal.
- Titans are not earned through the earn meter, but rather from the Titan Terminal, and you can call the titan only once.
- There's a limit on how many friendly titans can be active on the field.
- There are 6 Hazard Levels, the matches always starts at 1, with a potential roll at every objective completed to increase it one level.
- The total amount of objectives is slighly randomized and never told to players to hold a surprise when the Extraction Dropship comes in.
- When the extraction stage starts, the respawn terminal is disabled and players needs to survive until it arrives.
